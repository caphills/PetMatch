### Getting started 
<p>To run one of the tests locally on your computer, perform the following steps</p>

1. Change directory to the project root directory (PetMatch).

2. Run the following command to make sure you have the testing dependencies (nightmare and mocha) available locally:
<pre>npm install</pre>

3. Start the server.
<pre>nodemon server.js</pre>
<p>If you don't have nodemon installed, you can also start the server using node:</p>
<pre>node server.js</pre>

### Troubleshooting
* If a test does not pass...
	* Open the test script and ensure that the test is accurately described and up-to-date.
	* Ensure that the server is running.
	* File a GitHub issue if root cause cannot be determined.

### Loading a page
The app consists of several pages. Here's how you can test that these pages load successfully.

1. Run the following command from the project root directory (PetMatch):
<pre>npm test ./ui-testing/load-page-test.js</pre>

2. Verify that all checks pass.
If all checks pass, all pages load without error.

### Taking the pet compatibility quiz
<p>STORY: As a user, I want to be able to take a quiz that matches me up with a pet based on my interests, personality, and preferences. The quiz should return the results.</p>

<p>Here's how you can test this story:</p>

1. Run the following command from the project root directory (PetMatch):
<pre>npm test ./ui-testing/nightmare/take-quiz-test.js</pre>
<p>An Electron browser window will open and take you through the pet compatibility quiz workflow.</p>

2. Verify that there are no errors and the quiz results modal opens.
